Description: Joint DNA-based disaster victim identification (DVI), as described in 
    Vigeland and Egeland (2021) <doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-296414/v1>. Joint 
    Victim identification is performed by optimising the joint likelihood of all 
    genotyped individuals. Individual identification probabilities, conditional on
    all available information, are derived from the joint solution in the form of 
    posterior pairing probabilities. 'dvir' is part of the 'ped suite' ecosystem 
    for pedigree analysis, and relies in particular on 'forrel' for computation 
    of likelihood ratios.
