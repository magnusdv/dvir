Description: Joint DNA-based disaster victim identification (DVI), as described in 
    Vigeland and Egeland (2021) <doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-296414/v1>. Identification is 
    performed by optimising the joint likelihood of all victim samples and 
    reference individuals. Individual identification probabilities, conditional on
    all available information, are derived from the joint solution in the form of 
    posterior pairing probabilities. 'dvir' is part of the 'ped suite' collection
    of packages for pedigree analysis. In particular it uses 'forrel' for 
    calculation of likelihood ratios.
