\title{Forward DVI selection, main function}
\usage{
forward(pm, am, vp, mp, LRlimit = 1, reduser = FALSE,
  singleStep = FALSE, twoStep = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pm}{A list of singeltons}

\item{am}{A list of pedigrees}

\item{vp}{Character vector with names of victims}

\item{mp}{Character vector with names of missing persons}

\item{LRlimit}{Double. Threshold for LR}

\item{reduser}{logic If TRUE, irrelevant persons are removed}

\item{singleStep}{logic If TRUE, one step analysis}

\item{twoStep}{logic If TRUE, two step analysis}
}
\value{
List with three elements corresponing to the three items
described above
}
\description{
The input is checked and the NULL likelihood calculated.
Three steps can be included depending on the choice of 
the corresponding the three logic variables
1) Impossible victims and missing persons can be removed based on 
genotypes (if mutations are not modelled) or sex.
2) A one step selection can be performed in which case an identification
is made if the LR threshold is met. The data is updated.
3) Pairwise identifications are done as long as possible and followed by
one steps if required.
