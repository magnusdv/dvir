\usage{
findExcluded(
  dvi,
  pairings = NULL,
  ignoreSex = FALSE,
  maxIncomp = 2,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dvi}{A \code{\link[=dviData]{dviData()}} object.}

\item{pairings}{(Optional) A list of possible pairings for each victim. By
default, \code{dvi$pairings} is used. If this is also NULL, the pairings list is
generated by \code{generatePairings(dvi, ignoreSex = ignoreSex)}.}

\item{ignoreSex}{A logical, by default FALSE.}

\item{maxIncomp}{An integer. A pairing is excluded if the number of
incompatible markers exceeds this.}

\item{verbose}{A logical. Default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with the following entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{exclusionMatrix}: A matrix showing the number of inconsistencies for
each pair (or NA if the pairing was not considered)
\item \code{excluded}: A list of three character vectors:
\itemize{
\item \code{pm}: victim samples excluded against all missing persons
\item \code{missing}: missing persons excluded against all victims
\item \code{fam}: families in which all missing members are excluded against
all victim samples
}
}

The above elements are removed in the reduced dataset.
\itemize{
\item \code{dviReduced}: A reduced version of \code{dvi}, where excluded victims/missing
persons are removed.
